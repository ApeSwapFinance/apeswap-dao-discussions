- [vote.apeswap.finance](https://vote.apeswap.finance/#/): Official snapshot voting platform

## Media
Generally, it's nice to colocate the media to the markdown files so they can be moved or deleted together and the links to them won't be affected.  

In this repo, the media files all reside under the same directory because we need to update the links when we paste in the markdown files into **Commonwealth** or **Snapshot** which makes updating them in a single operation possible.  

- `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`: Format is being used to prevent media file names from overlapping easily
